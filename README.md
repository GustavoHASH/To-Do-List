#if you have any doubts
Creating a new React project and deploying the code can seem daunting at first, but it's actually quite simple. Here are the basic steps you can follow to create a new React project and deploy the code:

1-Install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager): React is built on top of JavaScript, and it requires Node.js and npm to be installed on your machine. You can download the latest version of Node.js and npm from the official website.

2-Create a new React project: Once Node.js and npm are installed, you can use the create-react-app tool to create a new React project with the basic file structure. Open a terminal and run the command npx create-react-app my-app, where "my-app" is the name of your project.

3-Develop your app: Once your project is created, you can start developing your app. You can find your project files in the "my-app" directory. The src directory contains the main code for your app. You can edit the code as you like, using React components and JSX to build your application.

4-Test your app: You can run the command npm start in your terminal to start a development server, which will allow you to test your app in the browser. The development server will automatically reload your app whenever you make changes to the code.



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
